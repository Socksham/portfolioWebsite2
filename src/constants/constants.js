      "FarmToTable is an app that strengthens the connection between restaurants and farmers. Our goal was to have farmers be able to sell their produce directly to restaurants instead of going through a retailer. By doing this, not only will farmers get more business, but the restaurants buying from them will also be able to get more access to fresh produce instead of the unnatural ripening process that retailers go through in order to make quick profits.",
